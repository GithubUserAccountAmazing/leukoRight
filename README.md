Heroku has announced that they will no longer offer their free tier after November 28. 
<br>
I will be exploring other options to share this as a web application. In the meantime, an example gif can be seen below.

## todo


1. finish this readme file.
2. find suitable web app host?
3. find more cell image datasets/examples?
4. create a better model. 
  - the model is not perfect (seemingly due to an over representation of neutrophils in the training images). 
  - I am looking into ways to increase inference accuracy. 
6. <del>redesign webapp. currently barebones for demonstration purposes.</del>

## The model

the leukoRight model has been trained to differentiate the following WBC types.

- Neutrophil
- Band Neutrophil
- Lymphocyte
- Large (activated) lymphocyte
- Monocyte
- Basophil
- Eosinophil
- Metamyelocyte

It is also trained to differentiate Artifacts and Bursted Cells.

## .h5 file instructions 
<br>
I wouldn't suggest using the current model for any purpose, however, if interestedâ€”the leukoRight model tar file can be found in /models with the caveat being that because the file is very large (~32mb) it is split into 2 different parts:  
<br><br>

`partaa` and `partab`

<br><br>
To combine these files into a single tar file use the following command

`cat leukoright_model.tar.gz.parta* >leukoright.tar.gz.joined`

<br><br><br><br>
