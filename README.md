Heroku has announced that they will no longer offer their free tier after November 28. 
<br>
I will be exploring other options to share this as a web application. In the meantime, screenshots can be found below.

the leukoRight model tar file can be found in /models with the caveat being that because the file is very large (~32mb) it is split into 2 different parts:  
<br><br>

`partaa` and `partab`

<br><br>
To combine these files into a single tar file use the following command

`cat leukoright_model.tar.gz.parta* >leukoright.tar.gz.joined`

<br><br><br><br>


(in process)
